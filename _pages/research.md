**No wheat crisis: trade liberalization and transportation innovation in Quebec during the 1830s and 1840s**\
(Joint with Vincent Geloso and Alicia Plemmons)\
[European Review of Economic History](https://academic.oup.com/ereh/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ereh/head004/7078089)

In the first half of the nineteenth century, the wheat oriented agrarian economy of Lower Canada saw a rapid collapse in wheat production. These developments have been blamed on factors ranging from soil exhaustion to cultural conservatism and used to infer falling living standards in the colony. We provide evidence suggesting this collapse was largely the result of adjustment to the trade shock that followed the Colonial Trade Act of 1831 and a rapid reduction in freight costs between the Canadian colonies. Areas more exposed to external markets—as proxied by road access—shifted away from wheat production.

## Working Papers and Research in Progress
**The Impact of the Black Death on the Adoption of the Printing Press**\
(Joint with Noel Johnson and Alexander Taylor)

We leverage plausibly exogenous variation in mortality from the Black Death (1347–52)
across European cities to estimate the causal impact of market size on early print adoption.
Using the universe of data from the Universal Short Title Catalogue we create a database
linking early European printed material to historical city populations. We find that cities
whose populations were more heavily impacted by the Black Death were less likely to be early
adopters of the press and printed fewer unique book editions. We also provide evidence that
beyond own-city mortality there were also spatial spillovers from the Black Death shock.

**Soldiers & Surnames: the changing composition of English armies during the Hundred Years' War**

The development of European state capacity after 1500 has been linked to a Military Revolution in the 16th century that saw dramatic increases in the costs of warfare, in part
due to the need to recruit masses of professional infantry. Yet some historians have argued
that the roots of this process lay earlier in the Hundred Years’ War, a long running conflict
between the royals of England and France. In this chapter, I use tools from the field of
text analysis to analyze a database of over a quarter million soldier names from the years
1369–1453. Using soldier surnames as a proxy for social background, I find that the par-
ticipation of soldiers of higher social status decreased over the length of the conflict. I also
find suggestive evidence that the links between soldiers and their recruiting captains grew
increasingly impersonal compared with the earlier medieval era.

**Property Rights and Agricultural Productivity in Ethiopia**\
[Project Page](https://github.com/athoma5/ethiopia)

Development in many poor countries depends upon increases in agricultural productivity.
Institutions supporting property rights have been tied to productivity and growth through
two main literatures. In one, low productivity persists due to insecurity of property. In the
other, misallocation of agricultural land persists due to high exchange costs. I investigate
the relevance of these theories to agricultural productivity in Ethiopia at the end of the
20th century using subnational variation in an unexpected land redistribution as a natural
experiment. I link agricultural production data at the village and regional level with in-
formation on local soil suitability, yearly variation in rainfall, and market access. Using a
difference-in-differences framework, I find no evidence of an impact from redistribution on
agricultural yields or patterns of land investment.
