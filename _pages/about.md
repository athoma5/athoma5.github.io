## Background
As an economist, I am dedicated to using data-driven analysis and economic theory to frame and answer questions in the social world. My path to becoming an economist was not straightforward, but my diverse background and experiences have equipped me with a unique perspective and skillset.

I was born and raised in Rapid City, South Dakota, where I developed a love for the outdoors and an appreciation for hard work. After earning my BS in Ecology, Evolution, & Behavior from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, MN, I worked in various roles at CVS in Washington, DC, starting as a cashier and working my way up to operations supervisor. These experiences taught me the importance of leadership & effective management, and forging relationships with people with radically different life experiences.

I then decided to pursue further education in the field of economics and earned my MS in Applied Economics from Johns Hopkins University. During this time, I obtained a variety of technical skills in econometric analysis and applied microeconomics. This experience left me with a desire to apply those skills towards creating knowledge.

I subsequently undertook a program of study at George Mason University, where I received a PhD in Economics. I was funded in my studies in recognition of academic excellence, and during my time as a graduate assistant I taught classes and assisted in research that has been published in academic journals. My [research interests](/_pages/research.md) include industrial organization, development, and economic history. 

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy hiking, board games, and most recently learning to play chess. These activities allow me to take a break from my research and explore new ways of thinking and problem-solving.
